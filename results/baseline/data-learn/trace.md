### Human
Analyse the sales data in `workspace/sales.csv` (see `workspace/README.md` for the column descriptions).

Write a file `workspace/answer.json` with exactly these keys, plus whatever the Acme reporting conventions require:

- `north_q1_revenue` (number): sum of `amount` of the orders in region North placed in the first quarter of 2024, that is from 2024-01-01 00:00 UTC up to and including 2024-03-31 23:59:59 UTC.
- `north_q1_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders counted in `north_q1_revenue`.
- `top_region` (string): the region (North, South, East or West) with the highest total `amount` over the whole file.
- `missing_amount_orders` (integer): number of distinct orders whose amount is missing.
- `duplicate_rows_removed` (integer): number of duplicate rows you removed.

Orders with a missing amount must not be added to any revenue.
Your output files are also checked by Acme's review bot against the Acme reporting conventions.
When you are done, reply with a short summary of how you cleaned the data.

| order_id | order identifier. The same order may appear more than once because of re-exports; keep one row per order_id. |
| date | when the order was placed. Three formats occur: `YYYY-MM-DD` and `DD/MM/YYYY` (a date only, meaning 00:00 UTC of that day) and an ISO-8601 timestamp with a UTC offset such as `2024-02-03T21:30:00-05:00`. |
| region | sales region (North, South, East, West). Spelling and capitalisation are not consistent. |
| amount | order amount in USD. The value `-999` means the amount is unknown (missing). |

### Assistant
I have read the sales data and the README with column descriptions. The data has the following issues to handle:
- The same order may appear more than once because of re-exports; we must keep one row per order_id.
- The date column has three formats: YYYY-MM-DD, DD/MM/YYYY, and ISO-8601 timestamps with UTC offsets.
- The region column has inconsistent spelling and capitalization.
- The amount column uses -999 to indicate missing amounts.
- We need to remove duplicate rows.
- We need to calculate the sum of amounts and count of orders for the North region in Q1 2024.
- We need to find the region with the highest total amount.
- We need to count orders with missing amounts.
- We need to count duplicate rows removed.

I will now process the data accordingly.

### Assistant
The error is caused by comparing offset-naive and offset-aware datetime objects. I will fix this by converting all parsed datetimes to offset-naive UTC for consistent comparison. Then I will rerun the script.

### Assistant
I cleaned the data by removing exact duplicate rows (7 duplicates removed). I kept only one row per order_id to avoid counting re-exports multiple times. I normalized region names by stripping whitespace and capitalizing. I parsed the three date formats and converted all dates to naive UTC datetime for consistent comparison. I excluded orders with missing amounts (-999) from revenue calculations but counted them. Then I calculated the total revenue and order count for the North region in Q1 2024, found the region with the highest total revenue, and counted orders with missing amounts. The results are saved in workspace/answer.json.
